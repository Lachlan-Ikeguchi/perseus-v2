# About this folder

This folder contains everything needed to build the docs. The actual docs themselves are located in `source/` and are intended to be viewed by going to the documentation website (TODO: link when up and running). You _can_ view the non-code docs here on GitHub, but your experience will be much better if you go to the website! Also, code documentation is _only_ available through the website, as it should not be on GitHub since it is automatically generated every time.
