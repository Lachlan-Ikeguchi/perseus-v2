# About this folder

This folder contains everything needed to build the docs. The actual docs themselves are located in `source/` and are intended to be viewed by going to the [documentation website](https://roar-qutrc.github.io/). You _can_ view the non-code docs here on GitHub, but large sections of it will not be rendered as it expects to be built by Sphinx! Also, code documentation is _only_ available through the website, as it should not be on GitHub since it is automatically generated every time.
